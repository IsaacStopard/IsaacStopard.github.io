# Isaac J. Stopard

I have recently submitted my PhD, which I completed in the [Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/qmee-cdt/). Under the supervision of [Dr Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/) and [Prof Thomas Churcher](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/thomas.churcher), my work involves modelling entomological measures of malaria risk given a changing planet (i.e. temperature). Recent work has focused on developing a novel mathematical model to estimate the extrinsic incubation period.
