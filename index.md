## Isaac J. Stopard

I am currently a PhD student in the Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training. Under the supervision of Dr Ben Lambert and Prof Thomas Churcher, my work involves modelling entomological measures of malaria risk given a changing planet (i.e. temperature). Recent work has focused on developing a novel mathematical model to estimate the extrinsic incubation period.
