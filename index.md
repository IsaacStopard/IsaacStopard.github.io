I am broadly interested in epidemiology, ecology and health economics. My research investigates the importance of different drivers (social and ecological) and intervention strategies on infectious disease transmission.

I completed my PhD in the [Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/qmee-cdt/), under the supervision of [Dr Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/) and [Prof Thomas Churcher](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/thomas.churcher). My PhD involved modelling entomological measures of malaria risk given a changing planet (i.e. temperature). Prior to this, I gained First class honours in Biology BSc from Imperial College London, spent many years beach lifeguarding at home in Devon and abroad, before working as an ecologist at a specialist consultancy for a number of years.

# Malaria
I am currently a research associate in the malaria modelling group. Recent work has focused on predicting the epidemiological impacts of novel dual active ingredient insecticide treated nets and developing a novel mathematical model to estimate the effects of temperature on the extrinsic incubation period. I am also interested in socioeconomic determinants of malaria transmission.

# HIV
Under the supervision of [Prof Timothy Hallett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/timothy.hallett) and [Dr Jessica McGillen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GUMB_uoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), at the HIV Modelling Consortium, we investigated the impact of failing to consider constraints to allocative and technical efficiency (in our case hypothetical) on the advice given by modellers. More recently, I have been investigating how best to incorporate equity considerations into transmission modelling studies, and maintain an honorary position in this group, with a specific focus on health inequality.
