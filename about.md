I have worked at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and [University of New South Wales Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).

I completed my PhD in the [Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/qmee-cdt/), under the supervision of [Dr Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/) and [Prof Thomas Churcher](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/thomas.churcher). Prior to this, I gained First class honours in Biology from Imperial College London, spent many years beach lifeguarding at home in Devon and abroad, before working as an ecologist at a specialist consultancy for a number of years.
