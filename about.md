Work: I have completed doctoral and postdoctoral research at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and [University of New South Wales Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). Previously, I worked as an ecologist at a specialist consultancy ([Fishtek Consulting](https://www.fishtek.co.uk/)) for a number of years and spent many years beach lifeguarding at home in Devon and abroad.

Education: I completed my PhD in the [Quantitative Methods in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/qmee-cdt/), under the supervision of [Dr Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/) and [Prof Thomas Churcher](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/thomas.churcher). Prior to this, I gained First class honours in Biology from Imperial College London.
